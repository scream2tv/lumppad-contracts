# ── The hash gate ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `aiken check` CANNOT assert a script hash: an Aiken test cannot read
# plutus.json and a validator cannot hash itself. So a stdlib bump, a
# `plutus = "v3"` change, a compiler-flag change or an accidental edit would leave
# every check green while plutus.json quietly carried different bytes. That is the
# D-1/D-2 off-chain-to-on-chain seam the V2 report says every real defect lived
# in, so it is enforced here, at build time, and not in prose.
#
# ── THE H_fail RECOMPUTE WAS REMOVED ON 2026-07-26 ───────────────────────────
# This function used to independently recompute `blake2b-224(0x03 ‖ compiledCode)`
# for `lumpfun_dao_fail.lumpfun_dao_fail.else` and compare it against a hardcoded
# 22c9a103… — because that hash was named IMMUTABLY at field 11 of every graduated
# Splash royaltyPool datum and being wrong about it was unrecoverable. The Splash
# path is PARKED and both `validators/lumpfun_dao_fail.ak` and
# `lib/lumpfun/splash_v3.ak` are deleted, so there is no always-fail script to
# recompute and no foreign datum naming it. The recompute is gone with them rather
# than left comparing a hash of nothing. See the banner in validators/lump_pool.ak.
#
# The `pool_script_hash` gate below is UNAFFECTED and is now the whole of this
# function's job — and it is the more load-bearing of the two, because
# `lump_mint_v3` takes that hash as a PARAMETER and nothing inside the Aiken tree
# can bind parameter application.
